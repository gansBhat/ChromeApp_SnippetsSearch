# Snippets Quick Search

A chrome app to maintain favorite commands and snippets for easy searching and modification.
Many developers maintain a text file & notepad++ for this, however there are some downsides to it.


This project aimed towards keeping it simple and fast to get to our commands and code snippets, build an entire commands DB over the period of time - OFFLINE. Hence the data security is maintained and company policies are not violated.
